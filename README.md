# Trip Recommendation

This repository contains the source code for a recommendation system which uses both **content based** and **collaborative filtering** techniques to come up with good recommendation of places to visit for any particular user. We conducted a **survey** with 70+ users to create the **dataset** manually.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

We have used Windows 10 OS to develop this project.
You need to install Anaconda for python 3 to manage this project. Just follow this [link](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and download the software.

### Installing

After the download of Anaconda ends, you need to install the software. Just follow the installer wizard by clicking **next** on each step and install the software.

Once done, you can open the application by double clicking on its icon and then launch Spyder from the application. Open the **main.py** file from the project directory and run it.
The **temporary_working_documents** folder contains all the intermediate files generated after each step of data cleanup.

## Deployment

To deploy the project, install python 3 along with its scientific libraries like **numpy** and **sci-kit** on your live server. Then run the **main.py** file to execute the program.
